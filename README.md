# Snowtrace Backend

## Overview

Snowtrace Backend is a Node.js application that fetches data from [snowtrace.io](https://snowtrace.io) using Puppeteer for web scraping. It utilizes Socket.IO for real-time communication with the frontend and cron jobs for scheduling periodic updates.

The backend fetches data at regular intervals, processes it, and sends updates to connected clients via Socket.IO.

## Features

- **Web Scraping with Puppeteer**: Retrieves data from [snowtrace.io](https://snowtrace.io) using Puppeteer.
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes Socket.IO to push updated data to connected clients.
- **Scheduled Jobs with Cron**: Implements cron jobs to fetch data at specified intervals.
